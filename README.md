# FreeIPCC's vision and basic functions

## Vision:
Our vision is to create an open, flexible and powerful open source call center solution that enables global enterprises and organizations, regardless of size, to easily build and operate their own customer service systems.

We believe that by sharing source code, promoting technological innovation and collaboration, we can break the barriers of traditional call centers and benefit every developer, business owner and even end user.
